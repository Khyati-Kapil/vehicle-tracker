Vehicle Tracker App ðŸš—
This is a real-time vehicle tracking web application built using React and Leaflet. The app simulates vehicle movement along a pre-defined route, allowing you to visualize the vehicle's movement, rotate the vehicle marker according to the direction, and view route statistics such as distance and estimated travel time. Users can select different routes (today, yesterday, or last week) and start or stop the tracking.

Features

Real-Time Vehicle Tracking: Simulate live vehicle movement along a route.

Rotating Marker: Vehicle marker rotates according to the direction of travel.

Route Selection: Choose between different routes (today, yesterday, last week).

Route Stats: Displays route distance and estimated travel time.

Control Buttons: Start and stop tracking with a single click.

Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.

Tech Stack

React: JavaScript library for building the user interface.

Leaflet: Open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.

Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests to fetch route data.

OpenRouteService API: Provides driving directions and route data.

CSS: For styling the app and ensuring a responsive layout.



**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
